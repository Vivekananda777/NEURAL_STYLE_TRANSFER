## Overview
Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a deep learning technique that applies **artistic styles to photographs**, transforming ordinary images into masterpieces inspired by famous artists. This project implements a **Neural Style Transfer model using Python**, allowing users to blend an artistic style with any input image seamlessly.

## Features
-  **Apply artistic styles** to any photograph using deep learning.
-  **Custom style selection** – Users can choose their own artistic reference images.
-  **Optimized performance** using pre-trained deep-learning models.
-  **Python script & Jupyter Notebook** for easy experimentation.
-  **Example styled images** included for demonstration.

## Technologies Used
-  **Python** – Core programming language.
-  **TensorFlow/Keras** – Deep learning framework for model implementation.
-  **OpenCV & PIL** – Image processing and manipulation.
   **Pre-trained VGG19 model** – Used for feature extraction and style transfer.
-  **Jupyter Notebook** – For interactive experiments and visualization.
